# hi, it's twig.

I'm studying Japanese with the (eventual) intent to take online art classes like [Palmie](https://www.palmie.jp). And well, also just because I enjoy it.

If you're also studying Japanese and use Anki, [I made some decks]({{< ref "/Anki.md" >}}) you might find useful.

Otherwise, you can follow all the random music I listen to on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/ghost_twig) (it's mostly soundtracks, though).
