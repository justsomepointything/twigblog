I took a several month hiatus from making and reviewing anki cards...like about 5 months off. Doing too much anki can really burn you out.

But going through the 1000+ reviews revealed *a lot* of cards that still had incorrect audio and readings in the grammar deck. So I have gone through and fixed a bunch. 

If you already have this deck downloaded, I believe it will overwrite any changes you may have already made, and I didn't make note of which cards I changed (sorry). But the good thing is that more audio has been corrected.
