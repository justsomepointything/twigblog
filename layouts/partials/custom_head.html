Adding your branding / colors / css 
Add a custom_head.html-file to your 
layouts/partials-directory. In there you may 
add a <style>-tag, or you may add a <link>-tag 
  referencing your own custom.css (in case you 
  prefer to have a separate .css-file). Check out 
  the style.html-file to find out which CSS-styles 
  are applied by default.
